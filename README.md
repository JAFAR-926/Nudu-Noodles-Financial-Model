This project presents a financial model developed for Nudu Noodles (“Nudu” or the Company), a global leader in the manufacturing and marketing of noodle food products. The Company offers a wide range of cost-effective noodle products to consumers worldwide. Founded in 2000 by Nick and Dunamis after securing their first patent from the United States government, Nudu has grown into a competitive player within the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry.

The financial model was built using historical performance data to identify key business drivers such as revenue growth, production costs, gross margins, operating expenses, working capital cycles, and capital expenditure requirements. Revenue projections are based on historical growth trends, pricing assumptions, market expansion initiatives, and product demand forecasts. Cost of goods sold is modeled in line with manufacturing input costs, including raw materials, labor, and overhead expenses.

Operating expenses include selling, distribution, marketing, and administrative costs, modeled as a combination of fixed and variable components to reflect scalability and operational leverage. Working capital accounts for inventory cycles, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, with changes fully integrated into the cash flow statement.

Capital expenditure is projected to support production capacity expansion, equipment upgrades, and technological improvements. A fixed asset schedule tracks asset growth and depreciation, ensuring full integration across the income statement and balance sheet. The model also incorporates debt financing, interest expense calculations, principal repayments, and equity growth through retained earnings to evaluate leverage and financial sustainability.

The three-statement model integrates the Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement (Indirect Method), and Balance Sheet, all fully linked and balanced to support scenario analysis, sensitivity testing, and long-term profitability assessment.
